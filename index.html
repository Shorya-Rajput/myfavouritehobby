<div>About</div>

<p> My favorite hobby is reading books. I love all kinds of books; fiction, knowledge, everything. My favorite book series is Geronimo Stilton. It is fantastic and magical.I like to read books before going to bed or in the afternoon.A good book always brightens up my day.I have a lot of books. I like to read adventurous books. I love the English language.I love how the authors can make us cry or laugh through their books.Once I start reading a book, I cannot put it down and I won't even notice what is going on around me. Reading increases imagination, improve language, and so much more. Through reading, I got inspired to write stories.Reading is a very good habit.You can get so absorbed in a book.My  parents always buy me books.I just love flipping through the pages.I love reading books and I always will.</p>
